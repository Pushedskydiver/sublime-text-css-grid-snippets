## What is CSS Grid Layout?
To put it simply CSS Grid Layout (aka "Grid"), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces. It hasn't been added yet to modern browsers but is expected to be added within the coming months.

### What's Included?
You can see the list of the CSS grid snippets in the tables below. I have organized the tables into grid container and grid item snippets. Alternatively, once you install the package you can view the snippets in the Settings View.  Basically, it's snippets like `dg` for ```display: grid;``` and `gg` for ```grid-gap: 20px;```.
